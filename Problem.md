## Assignment 1 - Junior FSE MC1

***Building .NET core applications through TDD (Includes Patterns, SOLID Principles and Quality Code)***

### Objective
To develop Test Code for eDecor Application based on TDD Approach using NUnit Framework

### Concepts Covered
- NUnit 3.x installation
- Assertions - NUnit Classic Model

### The estimated effort to complete this assignment is 2-3 hours

### To Do :
    - Fork the boilerplate
    - Clone the repo in your local directory
    - Start coding in your local copy
    - Push the code in git
    - Submit the solution in Hobbes

### Boilerplate
[eDecorApplication Boilerplate](https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_dotnet_jrfse_assignments_boilerplates/nunit_assertion_assignment_1_boilerplate)

### Expected Outcome:
Assessment Solution should contain:
- Test code developed using NUnit Framework
- .NET Core Class Libraries for Business Logic and Data Access in conformance with the defined test cases

### Instructions
1. Fork this boilerplate repository
2. Clone the boilerplate repository and cd into it
3. Analyze the application requirements as provided with the [Readme.md](Readme.md) file
4. Design Test Cases for each requirement implemented
5. Test cases should assess the functionality for positive and negative scenarios both
6. Test cases should make use of NUnit Classic Model for Assertions
7. Build the solution as per the test cases 
8. Execute the test cases locally
9. Ensure all requirements are tested and test cases pass successfully
10. Push the solution to git and submit on hobbes for automated review
